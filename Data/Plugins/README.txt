		-- HealInterval = Seconds how often to heal yourself & whole party
		-- HealHPBelow = State of HP when to begin heal 0.99 = 99% 0.8 = 80% (NOTE: IT WIll heal only till the player is above this health, chances are that it will not fully heal you unless you set it heal at very low hp loss)
		
		To use Buffing for yourself & party enable "Buff Duration" in Z menu select 1-3 buffs and tick party check-box and the 2 check-boxes inside Party settings of (Z) menu. Also enable AutoHeal to self heal. Healing works only for elf.
		
		Offline Leveling will now choose a target and will not search for new one until its killed and will not walk without a reason if the target is within skill range
